        Elevator Pitch
    </h1>
    <p>
Hi, my name is precious Olorunmaiye,I’m a dedicated software engineering student with a background in mathematics and problem-solving. Over the last few months,I’ve built several small applications, worked on coding challenges, and collaborated with peers on project-based learning.
My top three skills are problem solving, adaptability, and technical communication. I stand out because I’m passionate about continuous learning, I’m comfortable working under pressure, and I’m deeply committed to delivering clean, efficient code.
I bring value by helping teams deliver scalable software solutions that actually
solve user problems while making the development process smoother through
clear documentation and collaboration.
I’m currently looking for internship opportunities or entry-level roles where I can contribute and grow. If you’re hiring or know someone who is, I’d love a chance to speak further.
Thank you for your time,I’m excited to bring my passion and dedication to the right team.
