    <h1>Bio</h1>

    <p>
I am Precious Olorunmaiye. I am a 20 year old girl. I am currently training in Software
Engineering and has a background in social media management and public
relations. I aims to become a skilled software engineer and work on
impactful projects, both locally and globally. I also have  earned a Virtual Assistant
Certification from ALX and has volunteered in PR roles, gaining valuable
teamwork and communication skills

My goal is to become a Full Stack Software Engineer and use my work to create solutions that make an impact.


I care deeply about the empowerment of women, especially in tech, because I believe when women are supported, communities grow stronger. Along my journey, Iâ€™ve learned that success in this field comes from continuous learning, building real projects, and mastering communication with teams.
